<h1 class="topictitle1"><span>Service Access from WebSphere MQ: one-way</span> pattern</h1>
<div>
	<p class="shortdesc">
	Use the 
	<span>Service Access from WebSphere MQ: one-way</span> 
	pattern to process WebSphere MQ XML messages by using 
	the data contained in the pattern to call a web service.
	</p>
	<p>
	Use this pattern to bridge the reliable WebSphere MQ messaging protocol of client applications 
	with the synchronous requests to services
	to handle updates with an assurance that either the request succeeds or that failures, 
	including timeouts, are reliably reported.  
	</p>
	<p>
	This pattern provides loose coupling between client applications 
	and service providers in timing,  
	protocols, and transport. It is appropriate for interfacing services 
	 to existing systems.
	</p>

	<h2 class="sectiontitle">Solution</h2>
<p>
	The solution is to implement a message flow that provides an entry point 
	for WebSphere MQ messages. 
	When a message is received, the data is incorporated into the body of a web service request
	and the target service is called.</p>
<p>	This pattern does not return a response to the client application, 
but it does check for service response, 
service faults, or timeouts, and these are reported according 
to the error options that you have selected.</p>
