	<div>
		<p class="shortdesc">
		A number of constraints apply when you use this pattern.</p>
	<p>
	You can use the 
	<span>Service Access from WebSphere MQ: one-way</span> pattern
	only if you meet all of the following constraints:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Requests are received as WebSphere MQ XML messages.
		</li>
		<li>
			Requesting applications can generate an XML message that can be used
			as the body of a request to the target service.
		</li>
		<li>
			The target service requests and responses use CCSID 1208.
		</li>
		<li>
			WSDLs must contain the definitions that define the properties 
			for the SOAPRequest node in the
			definitions of the top level WSDL. 
			Therefore, some complex nested WSDLs cannot automatically
			be processed by the pattern.
			<p>If WSDLs that do not meet this constraint are used, 
			the pattern does not configure the SOAPRequest node, 
			but lists configuration of the SOAPRequest node as a task to complete 
			after generation of the pattern instance.</p> 			
		</li>
		<li>
			The pattern defines its own format for the logging and error messages; it is 
			assumed that these messages are sufficient to meet the requirements in your own 
			environment.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	Some of the preceding constraints, particularly the CCSID, can be overcome by the use of a
	transformation. The Request Processor subflow is included as the place where 
	any required transformation is added. </p>
