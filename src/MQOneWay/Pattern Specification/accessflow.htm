	<ol>
		<li>
			A WebSphere MQ XML message is received on an MQInput node. 
			If validation is required by the pattern parameters, this action is performed immediately.
		</li>
		<li>
			The message passes to the Request Processing subflow, which provides a place 
			to customize a pattern instance. 
			The message must have the content, including namespaces, that is 
			required for the body of the target provider service. 
			If the incoming message does not meet this requirement, 
			it must be corrected in the Request Processor subflow.
		</li>
		<li>
			The message is passed to a SOAPRequest node, which adds the SOAP envelope 
			and calls the target service.
		</li>
		<li>
			Any response from the service, which is not a fault, is passed to the Log subflow,
			which writes a log message if required. 
			At this point, the second branch from the FlowOrder node starts, and passes the
			incoming message to the Log subflow, which also writes a log message if required.
		</li>
		<li>
			If a fault is returned or a timeout is encountered, 
			the fault information is passed to the Error subflow for processing.
		</li>
