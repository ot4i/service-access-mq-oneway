	<h1 class="topictitle1">Error subflow for the 
	<span>Service Access from WebSphere MQ: one-way</span> pattern</h1>
	<p class="shortdesc">This subflow tests whether an error notification message must be written. 
	Error notification messages do not preserve error data, 
	but are used to notify system management that an error has occurred 
	and that action might be required. The requirement for an error notification message is
	determined by the user-defined property: <span class="msobjprop">Error notification</span>.</p>
<ol>
<li>If you have configured the pattern parameters to include error notification 
messages and the user-defined property  
<span class="msobjprop">Error notification</span> is selected, 
an error message is prepared and written to the 
error queue. Details of the exception are written as an XML message. 
These details include:
	<ul>
	<li>Broker name</li>
	<li>Flow name</li>
	<li>Time stamp</li>
	<li>Summary of the exception data</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The summary of the exception data contains the message flow label, 
	error number, text description, 
	and a list of inserts giving further details.</p>
</li>
<li>This pattern is a one-way reliable pattern, and the
incoming message data must therefore be persisted in the case of error. 
	<ul>
		<li>If the <span class="msobjprop">Error action</span> value is 
		<span class="msobjpropval">Roll back</span>, 
		an exception is produced and the message is backed out onto the input queue, 
		which must be configured with a backout queue. 
		In this case, all error events are written to the event log. 
		You can use this action to detect the cause of the error.</li>
		<li>If the <span class="msobjprop">Error action</span> value is 
		<span class="msobjpropval">Error queue</span>, the incoming message is written
		as a persistent message to an error queue for later corrective action. 
		In this case, error events are not written to the event log.
		You can detect the cause of the error from the information 
		that is in the error notification message. 
		</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ol>
