			<ul>
		<li>
			Check that this pattern meets your business requirements and can be supported 
			by both the requester and provider applications.
		</li>
		<li>
			Select a unique name for the pattern instance. You can use the pattern multiple 
			times and create multiple different instances, which can be distinguished by 
			their names. Identify the purpose of the pattern instance so that you can decide 
			on an appropriate or meaningful name.
		</li>
		<li>
			Define or identify the target service interface, and create deployable WSDL in a message set
			project.
		</li>
		<li>Decide if validation of the incoming request messages is required.
		If your requester applications generate correct messages, validation might
		not be required.
		If you want to validate your messages, you must already have a message set
		to provide the message definitions,
		or you must create a message set to provide the message definitions.</li>
		<li>
			Identify the queues and queue managers. 
			You can use existing queue managers and queues, 
			for example, to access the provider application, and decide upon their names. 
			Identify any additional queue managers and queues that you require for this 
			pattern, and decide upon their names. Take into account any policies, 
			standards, or naming conventions that must apply.
		</li>
		<li>
			Decide whether you require logging of request messages. If logging is 
			required, you must decide to which queue manager and queue the logging 
			messages are sent. You can send logging messages to a general log queue that is used by 
			multiple message flows, or you can use a queue specifically for the pattern 
			instance.
		</li>
		<li>
			Decide if you want to handle errors by rolling back the input message or by writing
			the message to an error queue. If messages are rolled back, all error events
			are recorded in the event log.
		</li>
