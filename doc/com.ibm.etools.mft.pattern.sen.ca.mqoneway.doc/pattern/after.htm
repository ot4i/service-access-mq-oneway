	<span>Service Access from WebSphere MQ: one-way</span> pattern</h1>
	<p class="shortdesc">Tasks that you must complete after you have generated the pattern.</p>

		<ol>
		<li>
			Review the configuration of the SOAPRequest node. 
			In the case of complex WSDLs, 
			you might have to
			select the WSDL from within the Message Flow editor. 
			This requirement is shown in the summary file.
		</li>
		<li>
			Create the broker archive (BAR) file. 
			Add the generated message flow to your BAR file. 
			In the Broker Archive editor, you must select the <span class="uicontrol">Compile and in-line resources</span> 
			option before you build the BAR file. 
			You must also add any message sets that are referenced by the flow.
		</li>
		<li>
			Configure the broker archive file. 
			Further configuration of the message flow in the broker archive 
			file is not required before you deploy the message flows for your
			<span>Service Access from WebSphere MQ: one-way</span>
			pattern instance, but you might want to review some of the default options and 
			configure changes for your environment. 
			For example, you might want to review the following properties:
			<ul>
				<li><span class="msobjprop">Request logging required</span> and
				<span class="msobjprop">Response logging required</span>. 
					Use these properties to switch logging on and off.
					When you turn logging on, you must check that the logging queue is
					correctly defined for your environment.
				</li>
				<li><span class="msobjprop">ErrorLoggingOn</span>. 
					If error messages are included, 
					at deployment time this switch determines whether 
					logging of errors is required for the current environment.
				</li>
			</ul>
			You can change any of the pattern parameters that are listed in the 
			parameter tables as configurable, but you must be
			careful because the pattern might be assuming specific behavior. 
			However, you can 
			change properties that are determined by operational 
			characteristics and do not affect flow logic, for example, 
			security configuration or additional instances.
		</li>
		<li>
			Create queues and queue managers. 
			When you apply the pattern, a list of WebSphere MQ queues is 
			generated with queue names and queue manager names. 
			These WebSphere MQ queues and queue managers must be created if 
			they do not already exist. 
			For each queue manager that is created, the connection to the broker queue manager
			must also be created. All of the message settings that are required by the 
			pattern are set explicitly on the messages and are not dependent on queue 
			settings.
			<ul>
				<li>In the summary file, view the list of queues that you must create. 
				The summary file 
 				is located in the Pattern Configuration folder of the 
 				<i>InstanceName</i> pattern instance project.</li>
				<li>Create WebSphere MQ
					resources. You can create WebSphere MQ
					resources either on the command line by using programs and 
					utilities such as <span class="cmdname">runmqsc</span>, or by using the
					WebSphere MQ Explorer graphical interface. For more information about creating
					WebSphere MQ resources, see <cite>WebSphere MQ Intercommunication</cite>, 
					available on the
					 <img src="images/external_link.gif" alt="This link opens in a new window" class="external_link" /> 
					<a href="http://www.ibm.com/software/integration/wmq/library/" target="_blank">WebSphere MQ library</a> web site.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Deploy the BAR file. The message set containing the deployable WSDL must be 
			deployed by using the same or another BAR file, to every broker where the flows 
			are deployed.
		</li>
